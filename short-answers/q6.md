# Question
`fetch` returns a promise of the `Response` object. It has a lot of useful properties on it. Can you explain what each of these properties are for?

- `Response.ok`
- `Response.status`
- `Response.url`
- `Response.headers`

# Answer

1. `Response.ok` - tests if the requests between the server and client was successful

2. `Response.status` - gets the status of the connection or response, successful or not.

3. `Response.url` - the url of the response.

4. `Response.headers` - HTTP header that can be used in an HTTP response and that doesn't relate to the content of the message.
