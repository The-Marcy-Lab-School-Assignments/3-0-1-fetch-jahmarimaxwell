# Question
What are the two arguments that we pass into `fetch` and what do they do? What does `fetch` return?

# Answer
The only required argument is a URL of the API whose data we want to access. The second argument is the `options` argument. This is an object containing custom settings you want to apply to the request. `fetch` returns a Promise that resolves to a Response object.
